# ⚠️ Required Patch: `FixPluginTypesSerialization`

This modpack requires a special patch mod to be installed **separately** from the rest of the mods to function correctly.  
If this patch is missing or placed incorrectly, some mods may fail to load or behave unexpectedly due to Unity serialization issues.

---

## 🔍 Step 1: Check if You Already Have It

Navigate to the following directory in your game folder:
```
YourGameFolder/BepInEx/patchers/
```

Look for a folder named:
```
FixPluginTypesSerialization
```

If it’s there — ✅ you're all set!

---

## ⬇️ Step 2: If Missing, Download It

1. Download `FixPluginTypesSerialization` from Thunderstore:  
   👉 [https://thunderstore.io/c/repo/p/DaXcess/FixPluginTypesSerialization/](https://thunderstore.io/c/repo/p/DaXcess/FixPluginTypesSerialization/)

2. Extract the downloaded folder.

3. Move the **entire** folder to:
```
YourGameFolder/BepInEx/patchers/
```

> 🧠 **Important**: This goes in the `patchers/` folder, **not** the `plugins/` folder where the rest of the mods are placed.

---


## 💾 Installation/Additional Files

If you are installing manually just copy everything inside the plugins folder over to the bepinex/plugins folder including files and folders

Steps:

1. Ensure [BepInEx](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx) is installed.
2. Place all files into the `BepInEx/plugins/` directory.
3. Launch REPO and enjoy the enhancements.
